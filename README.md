### Intro

---

Program that uses a linear regression machine learning model to predict your grade in a course relative to the year. The model is trained on the data from the past 5 years and then tested on the data from the current year. The model is then used to predict the grade of the current year.

#### Here's an example of the output for the course CPSC 110:

<a href="url" ><img style="display: block; align: center;
           margin-left: auto;
           margin-right: auto;
           width: 60%;" src="example.jpg"></a>
