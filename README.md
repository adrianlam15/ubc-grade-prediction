# UBC Grade Predictions

Program that uses a linear regression machine learning model to predict your grade in a course relative to the year. The model is trained on the data from the past 5 years and then tested on the data from the current year. The model is then used to predict the grade of the current year. The data can be found **[here](https://github.com/DonneyF/ubc-pair-grade-data)**.

Here's an example of the output for the course CPSC 110:
